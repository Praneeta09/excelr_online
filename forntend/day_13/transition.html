    <p>Key Properties of CSS Transitions:
transition-property:

Specifies the CSS property to which the transition effect is applied.
Example: transition-property: width;
Use all to apply the transition to all properties.
transition-duration:

Defines the time (in seconds or milliseconds) the transition takes to complete.
Example: transition-duration: 2s;
transition-timing-function:

Specifies the speed curve of the transition.
Common values:
ease (default): Starts slow, speeds up, then slows down.
linear: Constant speed.
ease-in: Starts slow.
ease-out: Ends slow.
ease-in-out: Starts and ends slow.
cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n): Custom speed curve.
Example: transition-timing-function: ease-in;
transition-delay:

Specifies the delay before the transition starts.
Example: transition-delay: 1s; </p>

<pre>
    transition (Shorthand):
Combines all the above properties into a single declaration.
Syntax: transition: [property] [duration] [timing-function] [delay];
Example: transition: all 2s ease 1s;
Example Usage:
Notes:
Transitions only work on properties that can be interpolated (e.g., width, height, color, transform).
Use :hover, :focus, or JavaScript to trigger transitions.
The transition property enhances interactivity and visual appeal.



This means:

All properties (all) will transition.
The transition will take 2 seconds (2s).
The speed curve is ease.
The transition starts after a 1-second delay (1s).</pre>
